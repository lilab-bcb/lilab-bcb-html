However, such applications are currently limited by batch effects, processing, and costs. Here, we present an approach for multiplexing snRNA-seq, using sample-barcoded antibodies to uniquely label nuclei from distinct samples. Comparing human brain cortex samples profiled with or without hashing antibodies, we demonstrate that nucleus hashing does not significantly alter recovered profiles. We develop DemuxEM, a computational tool that detects inter-sample multiplets and assigns singlets to their sample of origin, and validate its accuracy using sex-specific gene expression, species-mixing and natural genetic variation. Our approach will facilitate tissue atlases of isogenic model organisms or from multiple biopsies or longitudinal samples of one donor, and large-scale perturbation screens.","tags":null,"title":"Nuclei Multiplexing with Barcoded Antibodies for Single-Nucleus Genomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562040000,"objectID":"1784a5eda538eb794a055ba0fdd062a7","permalink":"https://lilab-cbb.github.io/post/paper_published_in_nature_communications/","publishdate":"2019-07-02T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/paper_published_in_nature_communications/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Our nucleus hashing and DemuxEM paper is published in Nature Communications today!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556683200,"objectID":"699e032f47e0ff848081f2226887634e","permalink":"https://lilab-cbb.github.io/post/li_lab_website_created/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/li_lab_website_created/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Li Lab website is created!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Bo Li","Joshua Gould","Yiming Yang","Sirunush Sarkizova","et al."],"categories":null,"content":"scCloud is a cloud-based single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq data analysis framework that is scalable, cost-effective, able to process a variety of data types and easily accessible to biologists.

Advancements in next generation sequencing enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). However, interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes have proven difficult to map since short reads of 50–100 base pairs (bps) from these regions map to multiple locations in reference genomes. Standard analytical methods discard such multi-mapping reads and the few that can accommodate them are prone to large false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, that can allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genomes with high accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq, and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. The statistical formalism underlying our approach facilitates supervising of multi-read allocation with a variety of data sources including histone ChIP-seq. We applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis reveals that although the protein-DNA interactions sites are evolutionarily less conserved in repetitive regions, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions.","tags":null,"title":"Perm-seq: Mapping Protein-DNA Interactions in Segmental Duplication and Highly Repetitive Regions of Genomes with Prior-Enhanced Read Mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Li","Nathanael Fillmore"],"categories":null,"content":"A de novo transcriptome assembly evaluation package, which contains two components, RSEM-EVAL and REF-EVAL.

A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.**Results**We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene.**Conclusions**RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.","tags":null,"title":"RSEM: Accurate Transcript Quantification from RNA-Seq Data with or without a Reference Genome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Li"],"categories":null,"content":"As one of the first ChIP-Seq multi-mapping read allocators, CSEM allows multi-reads to be utilized by peak callers.\nPublications:\n CSEM paper  ","date":1310616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1310616000,"objectID":"d95408ac37bd0cfd3dfc86daaaaed08f","permalink":"https://lilab-cbb.github.io/software/csem/","publishdate":"2011-07-14T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/software/csem/","section":"software","summary":"As one of the first ChIP-Seq multi-mapping read allocators, CSEM allows multi-reads to be utilized by peak callers.","tags":null,"title":"CSEM (ChIP-Seq multi-read allocation using Expectation-Maximization)","type":"software"},{"authors":["D.

The state of the art for analyzing ChIP-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a relevant reference genome (uni-reads). This can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads. We describe a general approach for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads). Our approach is based on allocating multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets, we illustrate that incorporation of multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths, leads to detection of novel peaks that are not otherwise identifiable with uni-reads, and improves detection of peaks in mappable regions. We investigate various genome-wide characteristics of peaks detected only by utilization of multi-reads via computational experiments. Overall, peaks from multi-read analysis have similar characteristics to peaks that are identified by uni-reads except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications. We further validate a number of GATA1 multi-read only peaks by independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identify novel target genes of GATA1. These computational and experimental results establish that multi-reads can be of critical importance for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Discoevering Transcription Factor Binding Sites in Highly Repetitive Regions of Genomes with Multi-Read Analysis of ChIP-Seq Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**B.
