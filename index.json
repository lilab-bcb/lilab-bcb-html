Each requires customization to different tissue and tumor types, posing a barrier to adoption. Here, we have developed a systematic toolbox for profiling fresh and frozen clinical tumor samples using scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq, respectively. We analyzed 216,490 cells and nuclei from 40 samples across 23 specimens spanning eight tumor types of varying tissue and sample characteristics. We evaluated protocols by cell and nucleus quality, recovery rate and cellular composition. scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq from matched samples recovered the same cell types, but at different proportions. Our work provides guidance for studies in a broad range of tumors, including criteria for testing and selecting methods from the toolbox for other tumors, thus paving the way for charting tumor atlases.","tags":null,"title":"A Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus RNA-Seq Toolbox for Fresh and Frozen Human Tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Motivated by the recent discovery of translated novel unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs) using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we hypothesized that cancer-associated processes could generate nuORFs that can serve as a new source of tumor antigens that harbor somatic mutations or show tumor-specific expression. To identify cancer-specific nuORFs, we generated Ribo-seq profiles for 29 malignant and healthy samples, developed a sensitive analytic approach for hierarchical ORF prediction, and constructed a high-confidence database of translated nuORFs across tissues. Peptides from 3,555 unique translated nuORFs were presented on MHC I, based on analysis of an extensive dataset of MHC I-bound peptides detected by mass spectrometry, with 20-fold more nuORF peptides detected in the MHC I immunopeptidomes compared to whole proteomes. We further detected somatic mutations in nuORFs of cancer samples and identified nuORFs with tumor-specific translation in melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and glioblastoma. NuORFs thus expand the pool of MHC I-presented, tumorspecific peptides, targetable by immunotherapies.","tags":null,"title":"Thousands of Novel Unannotated Proteins Expand the MHC I Immunopeptidome in Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Hui Ma officially joins Li Lab today.

In transplant recipients, a variety of clinically important “indirect effects” are attributed to immune modulation by CMV, including increased mortality from fungal disease, allograft dysfunction and rejection in solid organ transplantation, and graft-versus-host-disease in stem cell transplantation. Monocytes, key cellular targets of CMV, are permissive to primary, latent and reactivated CMV infection. Here, pairing unbiased bulk and single cell transcriptomics with functional analyses we demonstrate that human monocytes infected with CMV do not effectively phagocytose fungal pathogens, a functional deficit which occurs with decreased expression of fungal recognition receptors. Simultaneously, CMV-infected monocytes upregulate antiviral, pro-inflammatory chemokine, and inflammasome responses associated with allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Our study demonstrates that CMV modulates both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory monocyte phenotypes, explaining in part, its paradoxical “indirect effects” in transplantation. These data could provide innate immune targets for the stratification and treatment of CMV disease.","tags":null,"title":"Linking Indirect Effects of Cytomegalovirus in Transplantation to Modulation of Monocyte Innate Immune Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

The current understanding of the nature of thymic immigrants is largely based on data from pre-clinical models. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to examine the immature postnatal thymocyte population in humans. Integration of bone marrow and peripheral blood precursor datasets identified two putative thymus seeding progenitors that varied in expression of CD7; CD10; and the homing receptors CCR7, CCR9, and ITGB7. Whereas both precursors supported T cell development, only one contributed to intrathymic dendritic cell (DC) differentiation, predominantly of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Trajectory inference delineated the transcriptional dynamics underlying early human T lineage development, enabling prediction of transcription factor (TF) modules that drive stage-specific steps of human T cell development. This comprehensive dataset defines the expression signature of immature human thymocytes and provides a resource for the further study of human thymopoiesis.","tags":null,"title":"Integrated scRNA-Seq Identifies Human Postnatal Thymus Seeding Progenitors and Regulatory Dynamics of Differentiating Immature Thymocytes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiming Yang","Bo Li"],"categories":null,"content":"Harmony-pytorch is an ultrafast Pytorch implementation of the Harmony batch correction method.\nHarmony-pytorch is released on PyPI as a Python package.\n","date":1579132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579132800,"objectID":"dcf7ff9e6821aa4ac0e26d23a68a38f6","permalink":"https://lilab.mgh.harvard.edu/software/harmony-pytorch/","publishdate":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/harmony-pytorch/","section":"software","summary":"Pytorch implementation of the Harmony batch correction method","tags":null,"title":"Harmony-Pytorch","type":"software"},{"authors":["Joshua Gould","Yiming Yang","Bo Li"],"categories":null,"content":"Cirrocumulus is an interactive web application for exploring single cell datasets.

Advancements in next generation sequencing enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). However, interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes have proven difficult to map since short reads of 50–100 base pairs (bps) from these regions map to multiple locations in reference genomes. Standard analytical methods discard such multi-mapping reads and the few that can accommodate them are prone to large false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, that can allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genomes with high accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq, and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. The statistical formalism underlying our approach facilitates supervising of multi-read allocation with a variety of data sources including histone ChIP-seq. We applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis reveals that although the protein-DNA interactions sites are evolutionarily less conserved in repetitive regions, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions.","tags":null,"title":"Perm-seq: Mapping Protein-DNA Interactions in Segmental Duplication and Highly Repetitive Regions of Genomes with Prior-Enhanced Read Mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Li","Nathanael Fillmore"],"categories":null,"content":"A de novo transcriptome assembly evaluation package, which contains two components, RSEM-EVAL and REF-EVAL.

A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.**Results**We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene.**Conclusions**RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.","tags":null,"title":"RSEM: Accurate Transcript Quantification from RNA-Seq Data with or without a Reference Genome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Li"],"categories":null,"content":"As one of the first ChIP-Seq multi-mapping read allocators, CSEM allows multi-reads to be utilized by peak callers.\nPublications:\n  CSEM paper  ","date":1310601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1310601600,"objectID":"d95408ac37bd0cfd3dfc86daaaaed08f","permalink":"https://lilab.mgh.harvard.edu/software/csem/","publishdate":"2011-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/csem/","section":"software","summary":"As one of the first ChIP-Seq multi-mapping read allocators, CSEM allows multi-reads to be utilized by peak callers.","tags":null,"title":"CSEM (ChIP-Seq multi-read allocation using Expectation-Maximization)","type":"software"},{"authors":["D.

The state of the art for analyzing ChIP-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a relevant reference genome (uni-reads). This can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads. We describe a general approach for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads). Our approach is based on allocating multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets, we illustrate that incorporation of multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths, leads to detection of novel peaks that are not otherwise identifiable with uni-reads, and improves detection of peaks in mappable regions. We investigate various genome-wide characteristics of peaks detected only by utilization of multi-reads via computational experiments. Overall, peaks from multi-read analysis have similar characteristics to peaks that are identified by uni-reads except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications. We further validate a number of GATA1 multi-read only peaks by independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identify novel target genes of GATA1. These computational and experimental results establish that multi-reads can be of critical importance for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Discoevering Transcription Factor Binding Sites in Highly Repetitive Regions of Genomes with Multi-Read Analysis of ChIP-Seq Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**B.

Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript set.

Previous computational methods either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to genes heuristically.**Results:** We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of 20–25 bases is optimal for gene-level expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing throughput is fixed.**Availability:** An initial C++ implementation of our method that was used for the results presented in this article is available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem .","tags":null,"title":"RNA-Seq Gene Expression Estimation with Read Mapping Uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Li"],"categories":null,"content":"RSEM is a widely-used RNA-Seq transcript quantification tool.
