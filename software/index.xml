      <description>PROBer is the first unified probabilistic framework for the analysis of a diverse set of sequencing-based ‘toeprinting’ assays. These assays are used to probe RNA secondary structure (DMS/SHAPE-Seq), detect epitranscriptomic mark (Pseudo-Seq), or identify RNA-protein interaction (iCLIP/eCLIP), which are important to understanding post-transcriptional gene regulation from all aspects.

      <description>RSEM is a widely-used RNA-Seq transcript quantification tool. RSEM papers are cited over 5,300 times. It was served in nationwide consortium projects such as ENCODE (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Altas). It is also recommended by HCA (Human Cell Atlas) for analyzing plate-based SMART-Seq2 single-cell RNA-Seq data.
